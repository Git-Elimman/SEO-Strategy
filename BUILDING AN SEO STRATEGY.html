            <p>Search has become integrated into the fabric of our society. With more than 197.9 billion searches performed worldwide each month as of April 2014, approximately 6.6
                billion web searches are performed every day. This means that on average about 7,500
                searches are performed every single second of every day.1
                 In addition, users have
                grown to expect that the responses to their search queries will be returned in less than
                one second. That said, let's dive in!</p>

            <div class="content">
            <h1>What is SEO?</h1>
            <p>We can't possisbly talk about SEO strategy without explaining in the slightest manner what SEO is or means.
                Search Engine Optimization is simply the process of optimizing or making tweaks to sites to get better results like better ranking on search engines, more website visits, sales etc.
                Today, there are many search engines in the world, some of which are Google, Bing, Yahoo! etc. The most used of these search engines is Google, as such, most marketers and business owners try to rank well on it.
                Once a business has gotten a website, it is safe to say they have opted into search engine channel. However, it is one thing to have an online presence and another to have it optimized for search queries.
                Below are the types of search queries users perform:</p>
                
                <h1>Navigational Queries</h1>
                <p>Users perform navigational searches with the intent of going directly to a specific website. In some cases, the user may not know the exact URL, and the search engine
                serves as the “White Pages.” </p>

                <h1>Informational Queries</h1>
                    <p>Informational searches involve an incredibly broad range of queries. Consider the
                    many types of information people might look for: local weather, driving directions, a
                    celebrity’s recent interview, disease symptoms, self-help information, how to train for
                    a specific type of career...the possibilities are as endless as the human capacity for
                    thought. Informational searches are primarily non-transaction-oriented (although
                    they can include researching information about a product or service); the information
                    itself is the goal, and no interaction beyond clicking and reading is required for the
                    searcher’s query to be satisfied.</p>
                    <h1>Transactional Queries</h1>
                        <p>Transactional searches don’t necessarily have to involve a credit card or immediate
                        financial transaction. Creating a Pinterest account, signing up for a free trial account at
                        DomainTools, or finding the best local Japanese restaurant for dinner tonight are all
                        transactional queries.</p>
            </div>
            <p> There are lots of factors that affect search engine rankings and traffic, we would go into that in later articles but for now lets delve straight into how to build an seo strategy.</p> 
            <div class="main">
                <h2> HOW TO BUILD AN SEO STRATEGY</h2>
                <p> Having a strategy is important for the success of any goal in life; the same can be said for search engine optimisation.
                    A strategy is a line of action, series of steps to follow to ensure the success of a goal.
                    The steps to building the right strategy for seo are:
                    <h2>Asking the right questions</h2>
                       <p>One of the biggest mistakes that marketers make when creating an SEO 
                        strategy is to start with the following question: ‘What keywords should we 
                        be focusing on?’
                        This is not a bad question. In fact it is a very good question, but it should 
                        never be the first question asked. The starting point for good SEO, as we 
                        have discussed more generally, should be creating the goals and objectives 
                        for the SEO channel (for example, will SEO be your primary channel?). 
                        Once you have covered those basics the next crucial step is a thorough 
                        understanding of your customers.</p> 
                        <h2>Persona development</h2>
                            <p>The best way to do this is to create audience personas. Consider the audience 
                            types you have and try to create no more than five distinct personas. This 
                            approach will help you considerably when you move to the next step of 
                            keyword research.</p>
                            <h2>Keyword research</h2>
                              <p>Having created personas the next job is to start to build your focus keyword 
                                list. This might seem daunting, especially as some companies have target 
                                keyword lists that run in the thousands. It is important to note that while some searches are just one keyword, increasingly 
                                people use natural language and therefore longer phrases.</p>
                            <h2> Create a Plan and Act</h2>
                            <p>After the above, you can now create a line of action from the knowledge gotten from the above and act on it accordingly. Success of an SEO strategy takes time to show; it is a long term thing - not something that happens within a  month or two, so you should be patient.</p>
